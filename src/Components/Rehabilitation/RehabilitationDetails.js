          Rehabilitation describes specialized healthcare dedicated to
          improving, maintaining or restoring physical strength, cognition and
          mobility with maximized results. Typically, rehabilitation helps
          people gain greater independence after illness, injury or surgery.
          Rehabilitation can also be explained as the process of helping an
          individual achieve the highest level of function, independence, and
          quality of life possible. Rehabilitation does not reverse or undo the
          damage caused by disease or trauma, but rather helps restore the
          individual to optimal health, functioning, and well-being.

            Physiotherapy rehabilitation aims to optimise patient function and
            well-being, to help integrate that patient back into their chosen
            lifestyle activities whether at home, work or leisure.
            Rehabilitation should focus on changes to functional disability and
            lifestyle restrictions based on the patientâ€™s own goals for
            functional improvement. Rehabilitation can be used for recovery from
            injury or disease and also for the management of long-term
            conditions (e.g. Parkinsons and MS). Rehabilitation should start as
            soon as possible to speed recovery. The programs that combine many
            different components are likely to be most effective.

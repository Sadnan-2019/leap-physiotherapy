            <p className="">
              Dry needling, also known as myofascial trigger point dry needling
              is the use of either solid filiform needles (also referred to as
              acupuncture needles) or hollow-core hypodermic needles for therapy
              of muscle pain, including pain related to myofascial pain
              syndrome. Dry needling is sometimes also known as intramuscular
              stimulation (IMS). Acupuncture is a broad category of needling
              practices with solid filiform needles. Modern acupuncture notably
              includes both traditional and Western medical acupuncture; dry
              needling is arguably one subcategory of western medical
              acupuncture.

            <p className="">
              Findings show that reflexology was practiced as early as 2330 BC
              by the ancient Egyptian culture. It is here that the origins of
              reflexology were developed. This is evidenced by the famous
              pictograph found on a physicianâ€™s tomb in Sarrara, Egypt. From
              Egypt it is believe that reflexology spread into India and from
              there in 100 AD, reflexology had spread to China via Buddhist
              monks. China developed its own techniques in reflexology and out
              of this comes the modern day acupuncture. As trade between regions
              and continents grew, reflexology spread. It finally made its way
              to Europe and in 1582 the first book of reflexology was produced
              by two doctors. It was believed at this time many middle Europeans
              were using some form of reflexology.
